When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
	- When you want to make your project open source and want others to contribute to your project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- When there are more than one contributers to the repository and all are modifying the same file
	  and you want to pull changes that onyl doesn't make any conflicts.
