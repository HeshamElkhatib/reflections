When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
	- When you want to make your project open source and want others to contribute to your project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- When there are more than one contributers to the repository and all are modifying the same file
	  and you want to pull changes that onyl doesn't make any conflicts.	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks copies a GitHub repository to another Github repository.
	clone copies a GitHub repository to a local repository or local to local.
	branch is simply a label to certain commit through which you can do simultanious and independent changes.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	- to know whether you are behined, ahead or aligned with that remote.
	- to allow you merge your local branch with local remote copy.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	- I will use for example dropbox
		what will be easier making changes: simply I will copy the whole project and then overwrite the current version
		what will be harder is to keep track of versions history and attach a description of the changes that we do by the time.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	- When the change you want to make doesn't represent just a newer version of the project
	  but a another variation of the current project.
	- When you aren't sure and the change you want to make is just an exprimental one.
	- adding to the master is simpler
	- making new branch helps you to do siumltaneous changes to both versions.
