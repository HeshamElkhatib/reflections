How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By displaying only the lines in which the differences happen.
    Identifying any typo mistakes
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    1- like the first example, it will help if there is a mistake in a latter version
       to compare the newer one against the older one.
    2- it will help to compare the outcomes of the newer version modification against the oleder ones
       like the GUI and decide which one is better.
    3- it will help if there are more than one programmer working in the same version and they want to compare their ideas and they wanna see both working.
    4- if you decided to delete specific functions/classes and realized that it was a wrong decision

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: as it keeps track of the different versions of the same project so it needs you to manually
          specify that I need the current version to be saved it has a lot flexibility and because you are the one who can realy decide when to commit 
    Cons: you may forget to save a state you will need to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    as it mainly oriented to programmers and usually a programming project will consist of more than one related file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First type git log to view the history.
    and then get the ID of the the commit that I want to view it's history

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because I have the old version so I can do whatever changes I want and then I can get the old version back
    using checkout operator with the ID of the most recent commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to control versions of my future projects
